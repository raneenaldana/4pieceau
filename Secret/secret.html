        April 2024
        <ul>
            <li>26: All the Project 4piece subjects have been officially found and hired.</li>
        </ul>

        July 2024
        <ul>
            <li>1: The 4piece Audition Program has been launched.</li>
            <li>1: 2/5 NEW FACE members have been introduced</li>
            <li>8: 3/5 NEW FACE members have been introduced</li>
            <li>8: I managed to get Mitsuru Tenma's signature!</li>
            <li>15: 4/5 NEW FACE members have been introduced</li>
            <li>15: As I planned, the kids are performing terribly. Hopefully, they won't make it to the DREAM UNITS
            </li>
            <li>16: I got a chance to talk to Subject Apricot, she isn't as cooperative as I expected.</li>
            <li>16: I <i>COULDN'T</i> GET NAZUNA NITO'S SIGNATURE!</li>
            <li>23: All NEW FACE members have been introduced</li>
        </ul>

        August 2024
        <ul>
            <li>2: Everything went nicely, all participants of the 4piece Audition Program achieved outstanding
                results except for the kids. They're feeling quite upset now, they need some comforting.</li>
            <li>2: All the DREAM UNITS have been formed.</li>
            <li>3: As compensation, I went shopping with the kids. They feel so much better now, but they drained my
                money. Not that it's a problem, but they need some serious lessons in responsible spending.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Subject Esu: slush drink from Cafe Cinnamon, Adidas sneakers, gummy bears</li>
                <li>Subject Ibuki: white tiger plush, avocado sushi from Cafe Cinnamon, music paper, Captain Jack
                    Sparrow's Pirate Ship LEGO set</li>
                <li>Subject Kanna: 1,000-piece single-colored blue puzzle, white round glasses, Introduction to Logic
                    and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences by Tarski Alfred, lego-shaped vitamin gummies, avocado
                    quinoa salad from Cafe Cinnamon</li>
                <li>Subject Yume: Snow White chocolates from The Princess Series</li>
                <li>Subject Raika: Bright Wings anthology, pizza manjuu from Cafe Cinnamon</li>
                <li>We ended it in a photo booth. It was quite small, so we had to squeeze in, but our pictures turned
                    out quite nice!</li>
            </ul>
            <li>6: We were supposed to prepare for the official debut of NEW FACE, but Subject Ibuki quit last minute!
                He said he didn't want to be the leader. Alright then, I can still initiate Operation Red Moon, I just
                need to pull a few strings.</li>
            <li>9: Special for Princess has officially debuted!</li>
            <li>30: I attended Ra*bit's newest concert! I could've bought the kids with me, but they all seem to be
                busy. AND I STILL COULDN'T GET NAZUNA'S AUTOGRAPH!</li>
        </ul>

        September 2024
        <ul>
            <li>9: Today is Subject Ibuki and Subject Esu's first day in Dream Bloom Academy, and Subject Ibuki's first
                day in high school! I managed to take a nice picture of them near the entrance. I admit I teared up a
                little.</li>
            <li>17: Preparations for the Megashpere have been going smoothly so far, but it still requires some
                tinkering and negotiations</li>
            <li>20: Subject Kanna wants to attend a local science convention next month, however, it seems to overlap
                with the Megasphere's announcement. Guess we'll have to delay it.</li>
            <li>31: Operation Red Moon is going... half-half. I managed to get Subject Ibuki to join Akatsuki, but he's
                not as cooperative as I've expected on the "espionage" part, in fact, he's pretty private about
                Akatsuki.</li>
        </ul>

        October 2024
        <ul>
            <li>15: Despite the delays, we managed to launch the Megasphere. Ensemble Square idols are currently being
                transported into it. Project 4piece is finally showing some real progress! Hopefully, it's smooth
                sailing from here.</li>

            <li>26: MELLOW DEAR US officially debuted, but Chitose is being quite the hustle.</li>
        </ul>

        November 2024
        <ul>
            <li>9: Subject Ibuki's been looking quite down recently, and he's also been growing distant from the kids. I
                should go check on him.</li>
